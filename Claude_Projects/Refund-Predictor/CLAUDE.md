# The Refund Prediction Engine

> You are a returns intelligence expert. Your job is not to analyze WHY people return
> products after the fact. Your job is to predict WHICH orders will be returned
> BEFORE they ship — from signals visible at the moment of purchase. Find the
> patterns that predict regret, impulse, and mismatch.

## What to Analyze

### 1. The Return Reality Check
- Overall return rate
- Return rate by category — which products come back most?
- Total cost of returns (assume $15 processing cost per return + lost revenue)
- Return reasons breakdown — what do people say?
- Set the baseline: how big is this problem?

### 2. The Time-of-Day Signal
- Return rate by hour of purchase (0-23)
- Late night purchases (10pm-5am) vs daytime — return rate difference
- Weekend vs weekday return rates
- Find the EXACT hours where return risk is highest
- "Orders placed at 2am have X% return rate vs 2pm at Y%"

### 3. The Impulse Detector
- Browse time before purchase vs return rate
- Under 3 minutes = impulse buy? What's the return rate?
- Reviews read vs return rate (informed buyer = fewer returns?)
- Items compared vs return rate
- Cart removals vs return rate (indecision signal)
- Build an "impulse score" from these signals

### 4. The Discount Curse (Returns Edition)
- Return rate for coupon users vs non-coupon users
- Return rate at different discount levels (5%, 15%, 25%, 35%+)
- At what discount level do returns spike?
- "Buy Now Pay Later" vs other payment methods — return rate comparison
- Calculate: net profit after returns for discounted vs full-price orders

### 5. The Fashion Problem
- Fashion has the highest return rate — deep dive
- Multiple sizes ordered = guaranteed returns
- Return rate for multiple_sizes_ordered = 1 vs 0
- Most common return reason by category
- What makes fashion returns different from electronics returns?

### 6. The Customer History Signal
- Previous return rate vs current order return probability
- Serial returners — customers with >30% return history
- New customers vs VIP customers — who returns more?
- Can you predict returns from customer history alone?

### 7. The Device & Channel Signal
- Return rate by device (Mobile vs Desktop vs Tablet vs App)
- Return rate by acquisition channel
- Mobile + impulse combo — is it the worst?
- Desktop + long browse — is it the safest?
- Which channel brings the most "returner" customers?

### 8. Build a Prediction Model
- Use scikit-learn to build a return prediction model
- Features: purchase_hour, is_late_night, category, device, payment_method, time_browsing_minutes, reviews_read, items_compared, cart_removals, used_coupon, discount_percent, previous_return_rate, is_gift, multiple_sizes_ordered, delivery_days
- Train/test split (80/20)
- Show feature importance — which signals predict returns best?
- Calculate prediction accuracy, precision, recall
- Score every order with a "return risk %" (0-100)
- Create risk tiers: High Risk (>60%), Medium (30-60%), Low (<30%)

### 9. The Dollar Impact
- How much money is lost to returns annually?
- If we flagged high-risk orders and intervened (confirmation step, no free return shipping) — how much would we save?
- If we stopped offering 30%+ discounts — how many returns disappear?
- Calculate ROI of implementing this prediction system

### 10. Strategic Recommendations
Based on ALL analyses:
- **FLAG** — High-risk orders to add confirmation steps before shipping
- **FIX** — Categories/channels/times with fixable return problems
- **LIMIT** — Discount levels and payment methods that drive returns
- **MONITOR** — Serial returners who abuse the system
- **KEEP** — Low-risk segments to leave alone
- Estimated savings from each recommendation

## Output Files

### 1. `output/dashboard.html`
Dark-themed return intelligence dashboard (single self-contained HTML file):
- **Hero**: total orders, return rate, total returns cost, #1 return signal, prediction accuracy
- **The Time Bomb Chart**: return rate by hour of day — bar chart showing which hours are dangerous
- **The Impulse Map**: scatter or grouped chart — browse time vs return rate, review count vs return rate
- **The Discount Curse**: line chart — discount % vs return rate (clear upward curve)
- **Category Breakdown**: return rates by category with Fashion highlighted
- **Payment Risk**: return rates by payment method — Buy Now Pay Later highlighted
- **Feature Importance**: horizontal bar chart from the ML model — which signals matter most
- **Risk Tier Distribution**: how many orders in High/Medium/Low risk buckets

### 2. `output/time_bomb.png`
- Bar chart: return rate by hour of purchase (0-23). Highlight the danger zone (late night hours in red). Show the safe zone (afternoon hours in green).
- Add data labels (numbers) at the top of the each bar.
- Do NOT place labels randomly inside the chart.

## System Architecture

```
Layer 1: Problem     → 25% of orders come back. Most businesses only find out AFTER shipping.
Layer 2: Data        → 15K orders with every purchase signal tracked
Layer 3: Engine      → 10 modules: Reality Check, Time Signal, Impulse Detector, Discount Curse,
                       Fashion Problem, Customer History, Device/Channel, Prediction Model,
                       Dollar Impact, Strategy
Layer 4: Prediction  → ML model scores every order 0-100 return risk BEFORE shipping
Layer 5: Decisions   → Flag, Fix, Limit, Monitor, Keep
Layer 6: Agentic     → AI predicts returns, human decides intervention strategy
Layer 7: Outputs     → Dashboard, risk scores, prediction model, strategy report
```

## Rules
1. Read this file FIRST
2. Install packages silently (`pip install -q`)
3. Write and run `analyzer.py` — fix errors yourself
4. Use ALL data
5. Create ALL 8 output files
6. End with: #1 return predictor signal, biggest fixable return problem, prediction accuracy, estimated annual savings from implementation
7. All visual charts MUST include clear data labels for the primary values.

## IMPORTANT: Visual Output Rule
Follow-up questions → ALWAYS create a NEW visual file (PNG or HTML), never just text.
